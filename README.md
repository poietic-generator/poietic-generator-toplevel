## Roadmap

1. (20%) __Develop a minimal front-end in VueJS + Typescript__ : The "component-by-component" development logic will make it easier to upgrade and replace interface elements. In addition, it will be easier to decline to a mobile version.

   - using the current Ruby API
   - allow navigation in sessions
   - allow the reading of an old session
   - allow participation in the game

2. (20%) __Rewrite the API in Crystal__ : Crystal is a programming language that is partly compatible with ruby and uses its syntax. It also provides an advanced typing system that facilitates bug detection, compilation and much better performance.

3. (0%) __Add support for websocket in the Crystal API + VueJS front-end.__
